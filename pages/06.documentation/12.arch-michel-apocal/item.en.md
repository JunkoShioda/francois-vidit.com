Daniel Dn 12,1-3.

1 â€œAt that time there shall arise Michael, the great prince, guardian of your people;
It shall be a time unsurpassed in distress since the nation began until that time.
At that time your people shall escape, everyone who is found written in the book.*
2 Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake;
Some to everlasting life, others to reproach and everlasting disgrace.
3 But those with insight shall shine brightly like the splendor of the firmament,
And those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars* forever.c
