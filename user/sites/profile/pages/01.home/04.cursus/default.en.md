##A Parisian that has connected in Tōkiō

Like my parents, I am parisian.

I have discovered japanese culture with the [go game][1] and I started to learn its language as an autodidact, aged of seventeen.

After my degree at the [National Architecture School of Paris-La Villette][2], I left to Japan.

He joined a company of conception and realisation of commercial networks for luxury brands in the largest japanese cities in the prestigious area of [Aoyama][3] in Tōkiō[^1].

On return to France, He changed profession and became interpreter.
