##to guide, it's to share !

It's to confront to different faces, experience the solemn character of encounter, to find oneself out of habits, and by there feel in oneself a new humanity coming forward, intimately and misteriously.

From there, to be lucky to find oneself ceaselessly rid of number of prejudices, ceaselessly more universal to the encounter of humanity and world.
