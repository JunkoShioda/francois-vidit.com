##### [color=#df8a13]Daniel Dn 12,1-3.[/color]

![«][«]  

|   | <span hidden>hidden</span> | 
| - | -------------------------- | 
| 01 | At that time there shall arise Michael, the great prince, guardian of your people; |
|  | It shall be a time unsurpassed in distress since the nation began until that time. |
|  | At that time your people shall escape, everyone who is found written in the book. |
| 2 | Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake; |
|  | Some to everlasting life, others to reproach and everlasting disgrace. |
| 3 | But those with insight shall shine brightly like the splendor of the firmament, |
|  | And those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars* forever. |
