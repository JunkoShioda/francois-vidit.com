   description: "In the Vendôme section, historical documents show the state of Place Vendôme in Paris in the 17th century. Doing so, it is possible to realize its state before the transformations of the 19th century (opening of Rue de la Paix and rue de Castiglione), including the presence of the convent of the Capucines and the enormous statue of King Louis XIV."
