    description: "In the section Chateaux de la Loire are presented documents that allow to deepen the understanding of some works exhibited in the castles of Chenonceau or Cheverny, for example texts extracted from Ovid's Metamorphoses, that inspired Francesco Primaticcio for the Portrait of Diana of Poitiers in Chenonceau, Eustache Le Sueur for his Ceiling or Jean Monier to represent Adonis in Cheverny."
