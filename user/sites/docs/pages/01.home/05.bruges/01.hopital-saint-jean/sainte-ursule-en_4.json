And when she had refused him and despised him at all, he shot at her an arrow, and pierced her through the body, and so accomplished her martyrdom. And one of the virgins, which was named Cordula, was sore afeared, and hid herself all that night in a ship, but on the morn she suffered death by her free will, and took the crown of martyrdom. And because her feast was not held with the other virgins, she appeared long after to a recluse, and commanded him that the next day following the feast of the virgins, her feast should be remembered. They suffered death the year of our Lord two hundred and thirty-eight. But some hold opinion that the reason of the time showeth that they suffered not death in that time, for Sicily ne Constantinople were then no realms, but it is supposed that they suffered death long time after, when Constans was emperor, and that the Huns and Goths enforced them against christian men in the time of the emperor Marcian, that reigned in the year of our Lord four hundred and fifty-two.<\/p>\n<figure><picture><source sizes=\u0022(max-width: 767px) 98vw, (min-width: 959px) 50vw, 86vw\u0022 srcset=\u0022\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-280.webp 280w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-380.webp 380w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-480.webp 480w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-640.webp 640w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-700x1733.webp 700w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-840.webp 840w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-1280.webp 1280w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-1600.webp 1600w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-1920.webp 1920w\u0022 type=\u0022image\/webp\u0022><\/source><img src=\u0022\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-700x1733.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022“Virgin and child and donatresses”, Shrine de St. Ursula, Hans Memling Museum, Old St. John's Hospital, Bruges (Brugge)\u0022 alt=\u0022“Virgin and child and donatresses”, Shrine de St. Ursula, Hans Memling Museum, Old St. John's Hospital, Bruges (Brugge)\u0022 class=\u0022class-40-img\u0022 sizes=\u0022(max-width: 767px) 98vw, (min-width: 959px) 50vw, 86vw\u0022 srcset=\u0022\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-280.jpg 280w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-380.jpg 380w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-480.jpg 480w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-640.jpg 640w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-700x1733.jpg 700w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-840.jpg 840w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-1280.jpg 1280w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-1600.jpg 1600w,\n\/user\/sites\/docs\/pages\/01.home\/05.bruges\/01.hopital-saint-jean\/02.sainte-ursule\/sainte-ursule9-1920.jpg 1920w\u0022><\/picture><figcaption>“Virgin and child and donatresses”<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There was an abbot that impetred of the abbess of the place where these holy virgins rest in Cologne, a body of one of these virgins, and promised that he would set it in his church in a fair shrine of silver, but when he had it, he kept it a year upon the altar in a chest of tree. And in a night as the abbot sang matins, the said virgin descended from the altar bodily, and inclined honourably tofore the altar, and went through the choir, seeing all the monks which, were thereof sore abashed, and then the abbot ran and found it all void and nothing therein. Then the abbot went to Cologne and told to the abbess all the thing by order. Then went they to the place where they had taken the body, and found the same there again. And then the abbot required pardon, and prayed the abbess that he might have again the same body or another, promising right certainly to make hastily a precious shrine, but he could none have in no manner.<\/p>\n<p>There was a religious monk which had great devotion to these holy virgins, and it happed that he was on a day sick, and saw a right fair and noble virgin appear to him, and demanded him if he knew her. And he was amarvelled of this vision, and said he knew her not. And she said: I am one of the virgins to whom thou hast such great devotion, and thereof thou shalt have a reward. If thou say eleven thousand paternosters for the love and honour of us, we shall come unto thine aid and comfort at the hour of thy death, and then she vanished away. And he accomplished her request as soon as he might, and anon after he did do call his abbot, and did him to be annealed or anointed. And as they anointed him he cried suddenly: Make ye place to the holy virgins, and go out of the way that they may come to me. And when the abbot demanded him what it was, and what he meant, he told to him by order the promise of the virgin. Then all they withdrew them a little after, and soon came again and found him departed out of this world unto our Lord. Then let us devoutly give laud and praising unto the blessed Trinity and pray him that by the merits of this great multitude of martyrs he will forgive and pardon us of our sins, that after this life we may come unto this holy company in heaven. <span><svg xmlns=\u0022http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\u0022 width=\u002222px\u0022 height=\u002222px\u0022 viewBox=\u00220 0 78 78\u0022 fill=\u0022lightgrey\u0022 opacity=\u00221\u0022><path d=\u0022M1.5 68.9991L20.9102 45.395c.88226-1.10283.88226-1.54397.88226-1.76454 0-1.10286-1.76455-3.30857-2.8674-4.632L5.90836 23.9997 16.49877 3.0455 27.5273 18.48544c2.87047 3.97028 10.80793 15.88413 10.80793 19.19267 0 1.76458-.6617 2.4263-6.6171 9.7051C17.1605 65.25246 14.95478 67.01703 7.01425 74.9545L1.5 68.99908zm38.16172 0L59.0719 45.395c.88228-1.10283.88228-1.54397.88228-1.76454 0-1.10286-1.76457-3.30857-2.86742-4.632L44.07312 23.9997 54.6605 3.0455l11.03157 15.43992C68.55947 22.45572 76.5 34.36957 76.5 37.6781c0 1.76458-.6617 2.4263-6.6171 9.7051C55.32526 65.25246 53.11957 67.01703 45.17904 74.9545l-5.51732-5.9554z\u0022\/><\/svg><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\u0022color: ;\u0022><strong>Jacobus de Voragine, “The Golden Legend”, Chapître 158 “the Eleven Thousand Virgins”<\/strong><\/span>  <\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<blockquote id=\u0022github-contrib\u0022><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>You have found mistakes ?
